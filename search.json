    "text": "ASSIGNMENT 3\na) Analysis of Biden-Xi Summit Twitter Data\n\ntop keywords: china, biden, xijinping, joebiden, America, americans, coronavirus, fentanyl, xi, uyghurgenocide\n20 top users: @potus, @joebiden, @politico, @eneskanter, @jendeben, @nwadhams, @nba, @washwizards, @pelicansnba, @capitalonearena, @kevinliptakcn, @foxbusiness, @morningsmaria, @scmpnews, @uyghur_american, @nytimes, @petermartin_pcm, @nahaltoosi, @phelimkine, @kaylatausche”\nNetworks analysis:\nThe keywords “Americans” and “America,” “coronavirus,” “fentanyl,” “Joe Biden” and “Biden,” “Xi Jinping” and “China” exhibit close connections, linking the COVID-19 crisis, drug-related issues (fentanyl), and the United States and China. The term “China” is also associated with “Taiwan,” “USA,” and “US.” Another prominent theme revolves around highlighting the rights of Uyghurs in China.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the top 20 users’ keyword patterns reveals the presence of seven distinct “clusters” that produce similar content, with the largest cluster involving five different users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb) Analysis of US presidential inaugural speeches\nA lexical dispersion plot is a graphical tool used to illustrate the distribution of specific words or terms throughout a document or corpus. In this particular lexical dispersion plot, we gain insights into the frequency of usage for the words “American” and “people” in the inauguration speeches of different U.S. presidents.\nIn general, it is observed that “American” is used less frequently than “people,” which is expected given the broader applicability of the term “people.” An exception to this trend is President Kennedy, who did not employ the word “American” and used “people” only once in his speech. Over time, it appears that the use of both words has shown a slight increase and/or has remained relatively consistent, with exceptions during the administrations of Presidents Nixon (1973) and Carter (1977) and Bush (2001 & 2005) as well as Obama (2009). Notably, the term “people” tends to be more prevalent in the early portions of the speeches.\n\nASSIGNMENT 2\nA. Building a Qualtrics Panel\nColumns needed for a panel: Email, first name, last name, external data references (e.g. demographics), language, embedded data (e.g. gender)\nI have created a Panel distribution with five different email addresses (panelist) and scheduled the Email Campaign for Sep 30th at 10:00 AM to participate in the Movie Surey.\n\nB. Google Trends Data\na) Google Trends Data on Trump; Biden; election:\n\nb)     gtrends R package\n\nc) Comparison between Google Trends und gtrendsR Package\n\nBoth dates and intervals are in the same format (YYYY-MM-DD; monthly); Google Trends allows to adjust the shown time period\nThe gtrendsR package provides a way to access Google Trends from R more easily and with more option to precise the data output/analysis compared to the online interface\nTo get a first insight into the data Google Trends might be a good starting point. However, for a more precise analysis one should use the R function.\nWith gtrendsR package it is possible the scarpae all available data sources at once, e.g. interest over time, by country, by region by dma, by city, as well as related topics and queries\nFor data analysis, utilizing the R package is more appropriate since we can directly access and utilize the data within the environment. The R package conveniently organizes various datasets into a list, whereas with the Google interface, data files need to be individually saved as CSV files.\n\nASSIGNMENT 1\nStructure, composition and order of the survey:\nIntroduction [Explanation of the survey, Thank you, Expense allowance (coupon)]; Questions about the services and experiences the participant have received [Q2-Q13]; Demographic (socio-economic) questions [Q14-Q18]; Conclusion\nTypes of questions:\nLikert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) [Q2], Single choice [Q3], Binary scale [Q4], Multiple choice [Q11],Dropdown menu [Q14]\nImprovements for the respondent:\nbetter respondent version for mobile and tablet; data privacy policy is missing\n--- all other tasks are completed in the survey on Qualtrics ---\nLink to the survey: https://utdallas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bl73gRWQZUfjOAK\nFurther assignment Diversity and Inclusiveness Survey\nThis survey is structured into three blocks: 1.
